*Recipe site*

i joined front-end mentor today and this was the first project i had to build as part of the challanges
from the project i picked up a few design principles
the languages i used are HTML CSS and js
they provide the assets such as images fonts and a few colors but allow alterations so i have added my own fonts and sizes
